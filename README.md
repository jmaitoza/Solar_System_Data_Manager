# Solar System Data Manager

Joshua Maitoza 8/11/2021

This is my submission for my Final Project.
The program allows you to store data about a solar system (input by the user) as either a System, Star, or a Planet

## Usage

To run each program individually either directly compile

```java
MakeSystem.java
MakeStar.java
MakePlanet.java
```

Or you can uncomment out methods bellow one at a time and run them individually from the Main.java program.

```java
MakeSystem();
MakeStar();
MakePlanet();
```
